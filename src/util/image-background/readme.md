# Image Background Utility / Helper Functions

A set of helper functions for an easier implementation of image background options in blocks.

This is not the same as "Background Utility". This is meant for blocks with image components used as simple background components, unlike more complex background implementations like Column Backgrounds.

This is use for the easy implementation of the ImageBackgroundHelper component.
